# Emotion-Recognition-Using-Facial-Exprssion
Facial expressions play a key role in non-verbal communication. Humans however can communicate non-verbally, now computers are also getting better at reading these emotions. Emotions are an indicator of oneâ€™s feelings. This project aims to recognize basic human emotions (happy, sad, neutral, surprise, angry, fear) based on facial expression.   It proposes a set of research scenarios of emotion recognition applications in the following domains: software engineering, website customization, education, and gaming.    In this project, we use web cameras to analyse the facial expression and detect emotions. This method is cost-effective as there is no need of using any special equipment. We use Keras which is an open-source neural network library and it contains numerous implementations for commonly used neural-network building blocks such as layers, objectives, activation functions, optimizers, etc.
